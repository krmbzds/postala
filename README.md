# Postala

Send email to multiple recipients from your Gmail account.

## Installation

Tested with `jruby-9.0.4.0`. Requires theÂ `gmail` gem. It is recommended to install the pre-release version of Shoes gem using `gem install shoes --pre` command. For now, you can then start the application by running `shoes postala.rb` in the console. I'm going to package the app in the future for multiple platforms. I'm waiting for [Shoes](https://github.com/shoes/shoes4) to be ready. Please check it out and contribute if you like.
